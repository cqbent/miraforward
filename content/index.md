## Vision

MIRA Forward New England envisions a nation where immigrants and refugees harness their power to thrive, and fully contribute to the social, economic, and civic fabric of our communities.  We are building a nation where all people can use their own voices and see themselves represented at all levels of government.

## Mission

MIRA Forward New England convenes, mobilizes, and advocates alongside immigrants, refugees, and their allies to create systemic change that upholds the rights, dignity, and opportunities for full participation in society.  We mobilize, support, and campaign for candidates that represent the values and interests of our immigrant communities.  We champion policies, policy makers and initiatives that prioritize immigrant and refugee voices, leveraging our collective strength to build a more just and inclusive society for all.

## Values

Immigrant and Refugee Centered: MIRA Forward New England is committed to uplifting the voices and experiences of immigrants and refugees, ensuring that they are central to decision-making processes and strategies that affect their lives. We prioritize inclusion of immigrant and refugee communities through education, leadership development, and advocacy efforts.

Anti-Oppression: MIRA Forward New England actively works to dismantle systems of oppression and discrimination, centering our efforts on anti-racism, inclusivity, and justice for all.

Fairness and Justice: Commitment to bold advocacy for fair and equal treatment of immigrants and immigrant communities, including equitable due process and protection from exploitation.
